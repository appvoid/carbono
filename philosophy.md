### Hey there!

Now that you are reading and got your attention, let me introduce and propose to you what i think could be a shift in how we train AI: carbono is a simple micro-library that aims to embrace web technologies and empower people with the future of humanity: which is AI itself. this is done by making it as extremely accessible as possible through the abstraction of various tools and a common packaging strategy to ensure standardization. 

carbono heads towards a future when machine learning models will be so common that people will need better ways to abstract away "scientific" details to ensure a proper distribution on customer facing applications. essentially, the goal is to make it super easy to iterate and distribute as easy as possible and without any friction. some of the advantages and philosophies behind the tool are:

| **advantages**              |   details                                                            |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Iterative**          | Trained models are simple files you can load back. Useful to resume work or just share it with people. |
| **Minimal**           | Tanh, Sigmoid, ReLU, SELU, and Softmax as activations. SGD or Adam as optimizers. MSE or cross-entropy as loss functions. Xavier as weight initialization. |
| **Informative**        | Generates a comprehensive summary of the training process. Includes loss, number of parameters, and training time. |

now, carbono is not "just" this library, is a set of tools/ideas/specifications that will hopefully at the very most change the way people use ai on a daily basis, and, at the very least, inspire others to create similar or better approaches than this. lots of changes will come and go as I iterate on this. you will wonder that the final "product" is just a concept, an idea, it's a way to build technology that is smart. enjoy the ride.

This engineering experiment comes with a lot of unexpected things that are planned to be ironed out through the process, expect big changes, especially, until v6, v7 or so.
